Konnichiwa,

Dis is my GitHub page? How did you get here? ...nvm

I do not know what I am doing here...

>You need to know git and use it

...they said. But boy did they knew what they've gotten themselves into?

I'm too lazy to type `git add . && git commit -m "lalala some changes here shalalala" && git push`

(No wonder why I loose track and my stuff)

***

Ok 'nuff jokes, this exists ~as proof of use git and backup of my dumb stuff,~ and because I needed it for school
